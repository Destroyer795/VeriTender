# VeriTender - Secure Government Auction System

## Project Overview
VeriTender is a secure, cryptographic auction platform designed to prevent bid-rigging in government tenders. It implements a **Zero-Trust Architecture** where bid amounts are encrypted client-side and remain chemically sealed until the official auction deadline.
